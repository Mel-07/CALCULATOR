## Overview

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

  I made use of the modules pattern to complete this project and also with the help to HTML5 & SASS/SCSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- PURE JAVASCRIPT



### What I learned


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  transform: translate(50%,4px);
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log(dis.value.slice(0,-1))
  console.log(dis.value = eval(dis.value).toLocaleString('en'))
  console.log('regex')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development
The use of REGEX to fix errors



### Useful resources

- [ resource 1](https://www.MDN.com) - This helped me for LEARNING ABOUT STRING AND CONVERTION OF NUMBER TO LOCALE STRING AND REGEX I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
